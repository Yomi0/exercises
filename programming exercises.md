  Programming Exercises
  
Chapter 1
  1. Personal Information
  
  Design a program that displays the following information:
  Your name
  Your address, with city, state and ZIP
  Your telephone number
  Your college major
  
  2. Sales Prediction
  
  A company has determined that its annual profit is typically 23 percent of total sales. Design a program that asks the user to enter the projected amount of total sales, and then displays the profit that will be made from that amount. Hint: Use the value 0.23 to represent 23%. 
  
  3. Land Calculation
  
  One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. Design a program that asks the user to enter the total square feet in a tract of land and calculates the number of acres in the tract. Hint: Divide the amount of entered by 43,560 to get the number of acres. 
  
  4. Total Purchase
  
  A customer in a store is purchasing five items. Design a program that asks for the price of each item, and then displays the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total. Assume the sales tax is 6%. 
  
  5. Distance Traveled
  
  Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula: Distance = Speed x Time. A car is traveling at 60mph. Design a program that displays the following: The distance the car will travel in 5 hours, 8 hours and 12 hours.  
  
  6. Sales Tax
  
  Design a program that will ask the user to input the amount of a purchase. The program should then compute the state and county sales tax. Assume the state tax is 4% and the county tax is 2%. The program should display the amount of the purchase, the state sales tax, the county sales tax, the total sales tax and the total of the sale (which is the sum of the amount of purchase plus the total sales tax). Hint: Use the value 0.02 to represent 2% and 0.04 to represent 4%. 
  
  7. Miles per Gallon
  
  A car's miles per gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula:
  MPG = Miles driven / Gallons of gas used
  Design a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and the number of gallons gas used. It should calculate the car's miles per gallon and display the result on the screen. 
  
  8. Tip, Tax and Total
  
  Design a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant. The program should ask the user to enter charge for the food, and then calculate the amount of a 15% tip and 7% sales tax. Display each of these amounts and the total. 
  
  9. Celsius to Fahrenheit Temperature Converter
  
  Design a program that converts Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit temperatures. The formula is as follows: 
  F = (9/5)C + 32
  The program should ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, and then display the temperature converted to Fahrenheit. 
  
  10. Stock Transaction Program
  
  Last month Joe purchased some stock in Acme Software, Inc. 
  Here are the details of the purchase:
  The number of shares that Joe purchased was 1,000.
  When Joe purchased the stock, he paid $32.87 per share.
  Joe paid stockbroker a commission that amounted to 2% of the amount he paid for the stock. 
  Two weeks later Joe sold the stock. Here are the details of the sale:
  The number of shares that Joe sold was 1,000.
  He sold the stock for $33.92 per share. 
  He paid his stockbroker another commission that amounted to 2% of the amount he received for the stock. 
  Design a program that displays the following information:
  The amount of money Joe paid for the stock
  The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he brought and sold the stock. The amount that Joe sold the stock for.
  Did Joe make money or lose money? Display the amount of profit or loss after Joe sold the stock and paid his broker (both times). 
  
  11. Cookie Calories
  
  A bag of cookies holds 40 cookies. The calorie information on the bag claims that there are 10 servings in the bag and that a serving equals 300 calories. Design a program that lets the user enter the number of cookies he or she actually ate and then reports the number of total calories consumed.
  
  12. Male and Female Percentages
  
  Design a program that asks the user for the number of males and females registered in a class. The program should display the percentage of males and females in a class. Hint: Suppose there are 8 males and 12 females in a class. There are 20 students in the class. The percentage of males can be calculated as 8 / 20 = 0.4 or 40%. The percentage of females can be calculated as 10 / 20 = 0.6 or 60%. 
  
  13. Ingredient Adjuster
  
  A cookie recipe calls for the following ingredients:
  1.5 cups of sugar
  1 cup of butter
  2.75 cups of flour
  The recipe produces 48 cookies with these amount of the ingredients. Design a program that asks the user how many cookies he or she wants to make and then displays the number of cups each ingredient needed for the specified number of cookies.
